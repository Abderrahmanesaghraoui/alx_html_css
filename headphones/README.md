### Testing
1. Verify responsive behavior by resizing the browser window to confirm the design switches correctly at the **480px** breakpoint.
2. Test interactions such as link hover and button hover to ensure they match the specified styles.
3. Validate typography by comparing the rendered fonts with the Figma design.
